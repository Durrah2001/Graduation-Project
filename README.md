# Smart Switch - IoT Lighting Control System

Project Overview

The Smart Switch project is an innovative Internet of Things (IoT) system aimed at simplifying daily life and enhancing the quality of life, particularly for elderly individuals and people with disabilities. The system allows users to control traditional lighting setups through a mobile application, either by using standard control buttons or voice recognition, providing convenience and accessibility.

Key Features
* Mobile Application Control: Users can control lighting through a smartphone app, allowing remote access to lights.
  
* Voice Recognition: Lights can be controlled using simple voice commands, supporting both Arabic and English languages, which is especially useful for elderly individuals or those with physical challenges.

* Hardware Integration: A small, easily attachable hardware device is placed on traditional light switches, ensuring compatibility with existing systems.

* Real-Time Communication: The system communicates seamlessly via Wi-Fi, offering quick and efficient responses.

Technologies Used

* ESP8266: Microcontroller unit responsible for Wi-Fi communication and smart device control.

* Servo Motor SG90: Operates the physical switch movement on traditional lighting keys.

* Android Studio: The platform used to develop the Android-based mobile application.

* Firebase: Provides real-time database functionality for user data and command storage.

* Smartphone: Used to run the mobile app that communicates with the hardware.

Future Enhancements

In future iterations, the system could be expanded with additional features like energy monitoring, integration with smart home systems, or even AI-based automation to predict user preferences.
